# EvilCG - Computational Geometry Prototype

**EvilCG** is a C++ library prototype for computational geometry, developed as a personal initiative.  
It provides tools for mesh analysis, geometric computations, and basic 3D operations.

## Features

- Compute bounding boxes (AABB and OBB) for meshes
- Mesh operations: center, vertex sum, surface area, covariance matrix
- Mesh checks: closure, manifold, self-intersection
- Intersection and convex hull computations (Prototype)
- Loading, saving, and basic triangulation of meshes
